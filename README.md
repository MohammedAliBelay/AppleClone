Apple Website Clone

Project Overview
This project is a static front-end clone of Apple’s official website landing page. It replicates the structure and design of Apple’s homepage using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with support from external fonts and icons.  
The main goal is to practice responsive web design, semantic structure, and modern UI styling.

Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for page structure and content
- **CSS3** – for layout and styling (linked externally)
- **Google Fonts** – for typography (Montserrat, Anton, Oswald, Alfa Slab One)
- **Font Awesome 4.6.2** – for icons
- **Local image assets** – for product images and logos
